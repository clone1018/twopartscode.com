title: "May 3rd 2021 - Intro to Live View"
---


## Introduction
Live View is an exciting new technology from the creators of Elixir & Phoenix Framework, it's focus is creating super fast, interactive web experiences without introducing a painful state management engine and traditional javascript bloat. 

For this live event we'll be building a real time chat application using Live View. Our core focus will be on the functionality of the application.

## Prerequisites
You'll need a basic Elixir environment setup and ready to go to follow along with this live broadcast. If you fall behind, or need clarifications, we can help after the recording.

We've put together a [Basic Elixir Development Environment](/elixir/basic-development-environment/) guide which can help you get started with a standard environment. It's not super specific for individual environments so some comprehension will be required.

* Elixir 1.10+
* PostgreSQL 10+

## Event Details
The event will be hosted live on [Glimesh.tv](https://glimesh.tv) on **May 3rd, 2021 at 3PM EDT**. You can find it hosted on the [glimesh.tv/TwoPartsCode](https://glimesh.tv/TwoPartsCode), if you register an account you'll be able to chat & interact live as we develop the chat application.

We'll also be recording and publishing the tutorial to YouTube after the live event has finished and this page will be updated with that video.
